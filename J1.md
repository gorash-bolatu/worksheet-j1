# Q1
__Fault localization__ is the process of finding the exact part of your code that is causing a problem. When your program gives the wrong output, you trace back through the code -- through __print statements,__ a __debugger,__ etc. -- to figure out where things went wrong.
# Q2
In Test Driven Developments, writing tests before writing code may have benefits such as:
* Your tests are not biased by your code
* Writing tests helps you think about how you might write code in the future
* Writing tests helps you think about the system's requirements
# Q3
Using **input domain partitioning**, we identify relevant partitions based on the age criteria for age-based discount calculation:
1.  Children (ages 0–12): 50% discount
2.  Seniors (ages 65 and above): 25% discount
3.  General group (ages 13–64): No discount
4. Invalid values (ages below 0)
5.  Boundary values to check correctness at transition points

**Example inputs:**
* invalid inputs: -1, 121
* children: 0, 17
* adults: 18, 64
* seniors: 65, 120
* `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, `Integer.MAX_VALUE`
```java
public integer discount(int age){ 
	if (age >= 18 and age < 65) return 0;
	else if (age < 18) return 25;
	else return 50;
}
```
# Q4
|**Partition Criterion**|**Valid Partition**|**Invalid Partition**|
|--|--|--|
|Number Inclusion|At least one number|No numbers|
|Lowercase Letter Inclusion|At least one lowercase letter|No lowercase letters|
|Forbidden Substring ("gmail")|Not present|Present (start, middle, or end)|
|Allowed Characters Only|Only letters, numbers, and `_`|Contains special characters (`!`, `-`, etc.)|

# Q7
Since loops are included (the loop between nodes 3 and 4), it’s crucial to notice that we would need to consider each path up to a certain number of loop iterations for testing purposes (e.g. we may limit the number of total loop to keep the set finite).
Then, paths that would achieve maximum path coverage as a test criteria are:
```
1257
12567
1357
13567
1343567
134357
```
